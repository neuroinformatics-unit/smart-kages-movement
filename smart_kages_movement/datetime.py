def extract_datetimes(
    df: pd.DataFrame,
) -> tuple[pd.DataFrame, dict[tuple[str, str, str], np.ndarray]]:
    """
    Extract the start datetimes and the frame timestamps for each video.

    The start times are stored per day, in a file named "adjustments.txt".
    This file contains a mapping between video filenames and their
    corrected start datetimes in the format "video_filename:H,M,S".
    We will read this file and adjust the start datetimes
    in the input dataframe accordingly. Invalid H,M,S values
    (e.g. negative numbers ) will raise a
    warning and be marked as NaN in the output.

    Additionally, we also have timestamps for each frame in the form of
    a file named "corrected_timestamps.pkl", stored in the same directory as
    the pose files. This file contains a dictionary mapping each pose .h5
    file to an array of corrected timestamps, in units of seconds since
    the start of the hour. The first element should be derived from the
    offset in the "adjustments.txt" file, and the rest should be derived
    by adding the frame timestamps (extracted from the .mp4 file) to this
    offset. If the first timestamp does not match the adjustment,
    a warning will be raised and the start_datetime will be set to NaT.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        A dataframe summarising all pose files
        and their corresponding video files.

    Returns
    -------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        The input dataframe with the 'start_datetime' adjusted or set to NaT.
    frame_timestamps: dict[tuple[str, str, str], np.ndarray]
        A dictionary mapping (kage, date, hour) tuples to arrays of

        (difference between timestamp of current frame and first frame).
